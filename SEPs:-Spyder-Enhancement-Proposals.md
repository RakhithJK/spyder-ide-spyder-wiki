This page serves to index the various Spyder Enhancement Proposals that we have set and are using to guide Spyder development.  Developers are encouraged to author SEPs for any development in Spyder that the community needs to discuss *before* code is written.  Currently, our protocol for SEPs is relatively simple.

The SEP author should:

1. Create a new wiki page with the title "SEP N: Title" where "N" is the next consecutive SEP number and "Title" is an appropriate title for the SEP.
2. Link to that wiki page from this page.
3. Create a GitHub issue for the SEP.
3. Notify that you have created the SEP and inform them that discussion is taking place
   on this issue (provide links to the SEP and issue).
5. Discussion should continue until consensus is reached.
6. At that point, a pull request or issue should be opened to track the actual implementation.
7. The SEP wiki page should be updated with information about the discussion and implementation.

Each SEP should have a table/area at the top with the following information:

<table>
<tr><td> Status </td><td> Active | Deferred | Accepted | Rejected | Implemented </td></tr>
<tr><td> Author </td><td> Full Name &lt;full.name@gmail.com&gt;</td></tr>
<tr><td> Created </td><td> April 6, 2013</td></tr>
<tr><td> Updated </td><td> April 26, 2013</td></tr>
<tr><td> Discussion </td><td> link to the issue where the SEP is being discussed </td></tr>
<tr><td> Implementation </td><td> link to the PR </td></tr>
</table>
