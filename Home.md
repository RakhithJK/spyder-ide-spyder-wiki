# Spyder wiki

Welcome to the Spyder IDE Wiki!

Spyder is a powerful interactive development environment for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features.

## Development

Spyder will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the MIT license. But while the whole team does its best to work efficiently we are always in need of contributors and developers to improve our development capabilities. Interested? please visit [[Contributing to Spyder]].

This wiki contains:

* [Development information](wiki/Dev:-Index)
* [[SEPs: Spyder Enhancement Proposals]]
* Spyder [[Roadmap]]
* A list of [Projects using Spyder](Projects-using-Spyder)
* [[Frequently asked questions]]

# Editing the wiki

Here are some general guidelines on editing this wiki:

* **All pages should use Markdown.**
* We are using pseudo-namespaces to organize pages.  This is accomplished by using prefixes for the page names, such as "Dev: The perfect pull request". Example prefixes are: "Dev", "Sprints", "SPEP", etc. **Please use appropriate prefixes for the pages you create.**
* Please add your page to one of our index pages, either this page or the index pages for one of the prefixes.
* If you find stale content, please remove it or better yet, update it.
