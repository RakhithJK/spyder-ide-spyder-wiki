## Recommended GitHub Workflow
Typically there are three types of people who use GitHub to access source code:
users, developers, and maintainers. 

[Users](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Github-Recommended-Workflow#Users) simply want access to the latest
code. [Developers](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Github-Recommended-Workflow#Developers) want to make some changes to the code. [Maintainers](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Github-Recommended-Workflow#Maintainers) are the
ones who make sure the changes to the code make sense, and incorporate them
into the code base.

## Feature Proposals
This section lists some of the active proposals under work for future releases. This should help to polish details before the actual implementation takes place. Some of this discussions could take place live on IRC/Hangout through the Google+ Community or via [Gitter](https://gitter.im/), any suggestions here?
