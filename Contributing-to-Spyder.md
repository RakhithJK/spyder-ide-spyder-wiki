## Code contributions

Spyder will always be :100:% open source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the [[MIT license | http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT]].

While the whole team does its best to work efficiently, we are always in need of contributors and developers to improve our project. You can find our contributing guide [here](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). It will help you to set up a development environment and start doing your own contributions to the project.

## Other contributions

Although a lot of people might think writing code that enhances or correct bugs is the only way to help in an open source project such as Spyder, the truth is there are many ways an user can contribute to make Spyder the best Python development environment.

### Creating, improving updating, documentation :books: 
If you want to know more information on how to improve the documentation, please go to our [docs repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-docs)

### Translating Spyder :gb: :fr: :es:
Spyder code and main documentation is written in English and will continue this way for its (hopefully long) lifetime. However, in order to reach more users in need of a powerful python development environment there is opportunity to translate the documentation and the interface into different languages.

If you want to know more information on how to provide translations for the documentation and/or the interface, please visit [[this section|Dev:-Translations]]
