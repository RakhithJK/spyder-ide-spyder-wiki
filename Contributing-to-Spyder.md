Spyder will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the MIT license. But while the whole team does its best to work efficiently we are always in need of contributors and developers to improve our development capabilities. 

Although probably most people think writing code is the only way to help in an open soruce project such as Spyder, the truth is there are many ways an user can contribute to make Spyder the best Python development environment, including but not limited to:

## Spreading the word

## Creating/Improving/Updating documentation

## Answering questions on Stackoverflow

## Translating Spyder

## Improving/Updating the website (Under construction)

## Filling issues and helping the community

## Answering questions

## Writing code

### Writing tests
