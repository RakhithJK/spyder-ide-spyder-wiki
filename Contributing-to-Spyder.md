**Spyder** will always be :100:**% open source software**, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the [[MIT license | http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT]]. But while the whole team does its best to work efficiently we are always in need of contributors and developers to improve our development capabilities. 

Although a lot of people might think writing code that enhances or correct bugs is the only way to help in an open source project such as Spyder, the truth is there are many ways an user can contribute to make Spyder the best Python development environment.

## Translating Spyder :gb: :fr: :es:
Spyder code and main documentation is written in English and will continue this way for its (hopefully long) lifetime. However, in order to reach more users in need of a powerful python development environment there is opportunity to translate the documentation and the interface into different languages.

The interface as of now (April 2015) supports English, Spanish, French and recently (Brazilian) Portuguese.
