## Roadmap for 2018/2019

* **August 12th**: *Spyder 4 beta 1* released, with all improvements developed while we were part of Anaconda, Inc.

* **December 15th**: *Spyder 4 beta 2* released, with:
    - Language server protocol integration, to make our Editor use the best code completion architecture available.
    - A new ``ipdb`` subpackage of `spyder-kernels`, to significantly improve debugging in Spyder.
    - Add a dark theme to the entire interface.

* **January 15th**: *Spyder 4 beta 3* released, with:
    - Major enhancements to projects, including the ability to define a ``conda``/``pip`` environment per project, graphical installation of packages in that environment and the use of ``cookiecutter`` templates to create projects.
    - Integrating the new ``ipdb`` kernel with Spyder, to enable syntax highlighting, code completion, history browsing and plotting while debugging (our most-requested new feature).
    - Full support for viewing any object in the Variable Explorer (Currently, only Dataframes, NumPy arrays and builtin iterables are properly supported).
