### The problem

[Anaconda, Inc](https://www.anaconda.com/) was supporting Spyder with a team of four developers working part time for the project for a year and a half. Unfortunately, that sponsorship ended in mid-November 2017. As Spyder was, is and always will be a community-developed and supported IDE, this was far from a mortal blow to the project, but it did impact the pace and breadth of development. Developer effort previously spent on our Spyder plugins, like [spyder-notebook](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-notebook), [spyder-reports](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-reports), and [spyder-terminal](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-terminal), among others, was refocused on the core Spyder IDE, and the development and release of Spyder 4 was delayed significantly.


### The solution

To help make up for the loss of funding, we are appealing to the community for support, asking users or companies who found Spyder valuable to back our project on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/spyder), in order to accelerate development and help us add more of your most-requested features to the project. We appreciate all the help you can provide us and can't thank you enough for supporting the work of Spyder devs and Spyder development.

We're extremely grateful for your positive response so far. We've gone from zero to a budget of well over $6500 per year, thanks to the continuing contributions of a lot of individual and institutional backers. We also had several new core team members and community contributors pitch in to help carry the load, and we've also gotten financial support from great organizations like organizations like [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org) and [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com).


### The importance of external funding

Thanks to Anaconda’s funding, Spyder has grown by leaps and bounds during the 2017-2018 (in scope and number of users), and we’d like to share with you some metrics you’re probably not aware of:

* Since the release of Spyder 3.0 (in September 2016), we have added ~7500 new commits, an increase of 50% with respect to the total number of commits in the entire history of the project.
* We are merging ~50 PRs per month. This is similar to the amount of work in the Jupyter notebook and JupyterLab, which have several developers working full time for them.
* We are receiving ~200 new issues per month on Github. This is similar to the most important libraries in the Python scientific stack (e.g. Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn) and much higher than the Jupyter notebook and JupyterLab.
* People are opening between ~2 to 6 new questions per day on StackOverflow with the `spyder` tag. Carlos Cordoba (Spyder maintainer) has made more than 5000 points in 2018 answering Spyder questions alone.
* Three new core, voluntary developers have joined the project during the last year months.

Thus, Spyder is in very good health and has signs to grow even more. But these numbers also make quite evident that we need a team to maintain a project with so much input from the community.
