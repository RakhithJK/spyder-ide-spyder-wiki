# Description
The idea is to have a basic abstraction layer and support for different version control systems, namely Git and Mercurial. [Issue 816](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/816) started the discussion and will serve as basis for this PR.

The plan is to have a minimal set of features that would allow common vc commands to be used inside spyder by calling the external programs (using a QProcess)
