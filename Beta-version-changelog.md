## Version 4.0dev

### New features

#### Main Window

* Add a dark theme for the entire interface.
* Add a new `Plots` pane to browse all inline figures
  generated by the IPython console.
* Several plugins were renamed to have a simpler interface:
  - `Static code analysis` to `Code Analysis`
  - `File explorer` to `Files`
  - `Find in files` to `Find`
  - `History log` to `History`
  - `Project explorer` to `Project`
* Add a new action called `Undock` to the Options menu of
  every plugin. This action creates a separate window that
  only contains the plugin and can be moved to a different
  place of the screen or to a different monitor.
* Add translation for Simplified Chinese.

#### Editor

* Add code folding functionality.
* Add autosave functionality to be able to recover unsaved files
  after a crash.
* Add indentation guides.
  They can be activated under the `Source` menu.
* Add a panel to show the current class and method/function
  where the cursor is placed, inspired by similar 
  functionality present in Microsoft Visual Studio. 
  It can activated under the `Source` menu.
* Allow setting multiple line length indicators under
  `Preferences > Editor > Display > Show vertical lines`.
* Add `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+,` and `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+.` shortcuts 
  to go to the previous/next warning and error, respectively.
* Allow scrolling past the end of the file. 
  This can activated in
  `Preferences > Editor > Display > Scroll past the end`.
* Add the ability to take into account code indentation and
  PEP 8 when adding and removing comment levels.
* Add an option to convert end-of-line characters on save.
* Add `Ctrl+{` and `Ctrl+_` shortcuts to split panels 
  vertically and horizontally, respectively.
* Add `Alt+Shift+W` shortcut to close the current split panel.
* After pressing a quote or brace the current selection gets
  enclosed on it.
* Add automatic docstring generation (parameters, return vals
  and exceptions raised) in Numpydoc and Googledoc formats.
* Add an option to its context menu to sort files alphabetically.
* Add the ability to reference issues on Gitlab (`gl`), Github
  (`gh`) and Bitbucket (`bb`) in comments or strings by using
  the convention `{gl/gh/bb}:my-org/my-repo#123`.

#### IPython console
* Add menu options to start consoles in Pylab, Sympy and Cython
  modes.
* Run cells through a function called `runcell` instead of
  pasting their contents directly to the console.

#### Variable Explorer

* Add MultiIndex display support to the DataFrame viewer.
* Add support for all Pandas indexes.
* Add support for sets.
* Add an option to its context menu (the one you get with a
  mouse right-click) to resize columns to its contents.

#### Files

* Add `Open With OS` context menu action to all files, 
  to open them with the user's Operating System
  default program associated with their file type.
* Add multi-select functionality (`Ctrl/Shift+click`).
* Add the ability to copy/paste files and their absolute or
  relative paths.
* Use special icons for different file types.
* Add an option to open files and directories with a single
  click.

#### Outline

* Show cells grouped in sections. Level 1 cells are defined by
  `#%%` (as before), level 2 cells by `#%%%`, level 3 cells by
  `#%%%%` and so on. With this new syntax, all  `n+1` cells
  will be conveniently grouped under n-level cells in the 
  outline tree.
* Add an option to sort files alphabetically. By default files
  are shown in the same order as in the Editor.
* Add a default name for cells to encourage users to name them.
  This way cells can be more easily spotted in the outline tree.

#### API Changes

##### Major changes
* Create one module per plugin in `spyder.plugins` and move
  there all widgets and utility modules used by that plugin.
  For example, `spyder.widgets.sourcecode.codeeditor` is now at
  `spyder.plugins.editor.widgets.codeeditor`.
* Create the `spyder.api` module to expose a public API
  for external plugins.

##### Minor changes
* Remove the `SpyderPluginMixin` class. 
  Its contents were added to `BasePluginMixin` (in `plugins/base.py`)
  and `PluginWidget` (in `api/plugins.py`).
* Move `SpyderDockWidget` to `widgets/dock.py`.
* Config pages of all plugins are now located in a separate module
  called `spyder/plugins/<plugin>/confpage.py`

#### Under the hood
* Deprecate the use of `debug_print` and use the `logging` module
  instead.
* Use the Language Server Protocol for code completion and linting
  in the Editor.
* Increase minimal PyQt supported version to 5.6
