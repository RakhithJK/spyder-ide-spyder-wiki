## Version 4.0dev

### New features

#### Main Window

* Add a dark theme for the entire interface.
* Add a new Plots pane to browse all inline figures
  generated by the IPython console.
* Create a separate window when undocking all plugins.
* Add translations for Simplified Chinese and German.

#### Editor

* Add code folding functionality.
* Add indentation guides. 
  They can be activated under the `Source` menu.
* Add a panel to show the current class and method/function
  where the cursor is placed, inspired by similar 
  functionality present in Microsoft Visual Studio. 
  It can activated under the `Source` menu.
* Allow setting multiple line length indicators under
  `Preferences > Editor > Display > Show vertical lines`.
* Add `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+,` and `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+.` shortcuts 
  to go to the previous/next warning and error, respectively.
* Allow scrolling past the end of the file. 
  This can activated in
  `Preferences > Editor > Display > Scroll past the end`.
* Add the ability to consider code indentation and PEP 8 
  when adding and removing comment levels.
* Add an option to convert end-of-line characters on save.
* Add `Ctrl+{` and `Ctrl+_` shortcuts to split panels 
  vertically and horizontally, respectively.
* Add `Alt+Shift+W` shortcut to close the current split panel.

#### IPython console
* Add menu options to start consoles in Pylab, Sympy and Cython
  modes.
* Run cells through a function called `runcell` instead of
  pasting their contents directly to the console.

#### Variable Explorer

* Add MultiIndex display support to the DataFrame viewer.
* Add support for all Pandas indexes.
* Add support for sets.

#### File Explorer

* Add `Open With OS` context menu action to all files, 
  to open them with the user's Operating System
  default program associated with their file type.
* Add multi-select functionality (`Ctrl/Shift+click`).

#### Outline Explorer

* Show cells grouped in sections. Level 1 cells are defined by
  `#%%` (as before), level 2 cells by `#%%%`, level 3 cells by
  `#%%%%` and so on. If using this new syntax, all  n+1 cells
  will be conveniently grouped under top-level cells in the 
  outline tree.
* Add option to sort files alphabetically. By default files are
  shown in the same order as in the Editor.

#### API Changes

##### Major changes
* Create the `spyder.api` module to expose a public API
  for external plugins.
* Create one module per plugin in `spyder.plugins` and move
  there all widgets used by that plugin. For example,
  `spyder.widgets.sourcecode.codeeditor` is now at
  `spyder.plugins.editor.widgets.codeeditor`.

##### Minor changes
* Remove the `SpyderPluginMixin` class. 
  Its contents were added to `BasePluginWidget` (in `plugins/base.py`)
  and `PluginWidget` (in `api/plugins.py`).
* Move `SpyderDockWidget` to `widgets/dock.py`.

#### Under the hood
* Deprecate the use of `debug_print` and use the `logging` module
  instead.
* Use the Language Server Protocol for code completion and linting
  in the Editor.
