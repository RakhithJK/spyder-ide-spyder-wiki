# Description

## scipy lectures notes
We could try to include a scientific python course in the interactive course like the one developed by the europython community that could be found here:

[GitHub page](https://github.com/scipy-lectures/scipy-lecture-notes)

[live preview](http://scipy-lectures.github.io/)

The course cover all the basics from numpy, scipy and matplotlib to more advanced topics like scikits image and learn, sympy and numpy optimization.
The content is great and cover most of the topics necessary for a beginner scientist that wants to start using python for its everyday content.

The content are written in rst, so we coud either fork the content and adapt it, or find a way to automatically sync to the upstream repo.
