# GSoC 2019 Project Ideas

## 1. Add Git/Gitub integration to Spyder

This purpose of this project is to create an external plugin that allows users to work comfortably with Git repositories in Spyder and also to submit their work to Github. In particular, this work should allow users to:

1. Review the status of repository (i.e. modified, added, deleted files).
2. View the diff of each file.
3. Commit work to the git repo, either in total or by hunks.
4. Browse git history.
5. View `git blame` and `git log` for each file.
6. Be able to easily define or create a remote on Github.
7. View current active branches and change between them.

### Motivation

This would allow scientists and engineers to easily keep track of their coding efforts through an easy to use graphical user interface.

### Expected Skills

Familiarity with Python, PyQt5, Git and Github.

### Available Mentors
